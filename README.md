# Calliope

Calliope is a local-first story-to-video studio. You type a story idea; Calliope drafts a storyline with beats, characters, and locations, writes a screenplay-faithful per-scene script, then **breaks each scene into shot clips** and generates one video per clip by driving your own ComfyUI install. When the clips are done, one click stitches them into a finished film with crossfades and matched loudness (ffmpeg). Everything runs on your machine: projects live in SQLite, media lives in folders, and no cloud service is involved beyond the LLM endpoint you point it at.

## Install — from source (npm + Python)

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ (npm)
- A running ComfyUI install, with the models your workflows need already set up
- An OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint — local (LM Studio, Ollama, etc.) or hosted
- ffmpeg on PATH — needed for film export

**1. Backend (FastAPI)**

```bash
cd calliope-backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv\Scripts\python -m calliope.main --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8247
```

Optionally copy `calliope_config.example.json` to `calliope_config.json` and edit it before starting (LLM endpoint, ComfyUI URL). You can also configure everything later in the app's **Settings** page. Never commit `calliope_config.json` — it stores your API key.

**2. Frontend (SvelteKit)**

```bash
cd calliope-web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. The dev server proxies `/api` to the backend on `127.0.0.1:8247`.

## First run

Calliope requires an administrator login by default. On first launch, open the
browser and create the account using the one-time code in
`calliope-backend/data/auth-setup-code.txt` (or your configured data directory).
The backend log prints the file's location. Choose a username and a password
of at least 12 characters. The code is consumed once; public visitors cannot
claim the account without it. No default username/password is shipped.

The username in the header opens **Your account**, where you can change the
password. **Sign out** revokes the current session. Changing or locally
resetting the password revokes all other browser sessions and API tokens.
Browser sessions expire after 12 hours, or one hour without authenticated
activity. Login attempts are limited to 10 per client address per 15 minutes.
Passwords are salted scrypt hashes; session/API tokens are stored only as
SHA-256 digests in a separate `auth.db`. Credentials are excluded from project
archives and Git. Each installation has its own administrator and shared studio.

From `calliope-backend`, these local commands retrieve the initial setup code
or recover an existing account without sending passwords through chat:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m calliope.auth setup-code
.venv\Scripts\python -m calliope.auth reset-password
```

Open the app, go to **Settings**, and set:

1. **LLM** — one or more OpenAI-compatible endpoints (base URL, model name, API key). Save several, then pick which one is **Active**.
2. **ComfyUI** — the base URL of your running ComfyUI (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8188`)
3. **Agent** *(optional)* — assign a specific LLM per agent role (see below)

Leave **Dry-run** off — it is meant for testing and produces placeholder results instead of real generations.

### Internet access and HTTPS

Keep the backend bound to `127.0.0.1` and put your HTTPS reverse proxy in front
of the app. It must proxy `/api/*` as well as the frontend, preserve streaming
responses for `/api/events`, and pass the public host and HTTPS scheme to the
backend. Trust forwarded headers only from your own reverse proxy. For
`https://video.parcosepino.net`, add that exact origin to `auth_allowed_origins`
in the server's private `calliope_config.json` and keep `auth_enabled` and
`auth_secure_cookie` set to `true`. Restart the backend after editing it.

Serve a production frontend build for public access. For example, build with
`npm run build` in `calliope-web`, then serve its `build` directory through your
web server while forwarding `/api/*` to the backend. API routes, downloads,
events, OpenAPI documentation and `/mcp` require authentication; frontend
HTML/assets remain public so that the login screen can load. Non-loopback
plain HTTP API requests are refused when `auth_secure_cookie` is enabled.

For a deliberately unprotected local installation only, `auth_enabled: false`
in the private configuration disables the login. For LAN HTTP without TLS,
`auth_secure_cookie: false` permits HTTP cookies. These switches are not
available through the web settings API.

### Queue settings

In **Settings → Queue** you can tune how the worker talks to ComfyUI:

- **Concurrency** — how many jobs run at once.
- **Poll interval** — how often Calliope checks ComfyUI for a finished job.
- **Poll timeout (seconds)** — how long Calliope keeps waiting on ComfyUI for a single job before failing it. **Default is `1800` (30 minutes).** Long video generations can easily exceed 10 minutes, so raise this for heavy workflows — or set it to **`0` to wait indefinitely** (until the job finishes or you cancel it).
- **Max retries** — automatic retries before a job is marked failed.

### Agent settings

In **Settings → Agent**:

- **Model per agent** — assign any saved LLM to each role: **Main agent, Planner, Story agent, Script agent, Assets agent, Video agent**. Blank means the **Active LLM** from Settings → LLM applies, so a single-endpoint setup needs no configuration here. A common setup is a strong cloud model for the main agent and planner, and a fast local model for the sub-agents. The Video agent's assignment also drives the MiniMax H3 prompt rewrite.
- **System-prompt rules (hardening)** — operator rules appended to every agent system prompt. Leave blank to disable.

## Using the app

The app walks a project through four stages — **Story, Assets, Script, Video**:

- **Story:** describe your idea and **Draft Storyline** — this opens a project-linked chat in the Agents view with the prompt pre-filled, and the agent writes beats, characters, locations, and misc. items. Edit anything by hand before moving on.
- **Assets:** each character, location, and item has its own **Image prompt**. Pick a workflow and shared settings (width/height/etc.) at the top, then click Generate per entity to produce reference images on your ComfyUI. Regenerate any single entity without touching the others.
- **Script:** **Regenerate Script** also opens a project-linked Agents chat (pre-filled) to rewrite the per-scene script. Scenes preserve the full screenplay: complete action prose and verbatim dialogue. Then **Break into shots** splits a scene into its shot clips — an LLM coverage pass allocates every dialogue line and action beat across clips of ~5–10 seconds (a 2-minute dialogue scene becomes a dozen clips, not one). Scenes link back to the characters and locations from the Story stage.
- **Video:** each clip gets rendered by a **Generate** pass that queues a job on ComfyUI with the right prompt and reference images (plus optional video/audio file refs). Clips marked **Continue from previous clip** extend the previous clip instead of cutting fresh — see [Continue from previous clip (video extend)](#continue-from-previous-clip-video-extend).
- **Enhance view:** after generation, open **Video → Enhance** to restore or upscale **one clip or all rendered clips** with a separate ComfyUI workflow. The original clip is supplied automatically; generation prompts, workflows and settings stay saved. Compare the original and enhanced videos, then choose which version to use in the film.
- **Film view:** once clips are rendered, **Export film** stitches them with ffmpeg: clips are normalized to 1080p at the **majority frame rate of the clips themselves** (24 fps clips export at 24 fps; mixed-rate projects conform to whichever rate most clips use), joined with 0.5s crossfades, and loudness-normalized into one final file.
- When everything is done the project is automatically marked **Completed**.

**Playground** is a free-form generation page outside the project pipeline: run any imported workflow with arbitrary inputs, upload your own files (image / video / audio) as inputs, and optionally attach a result to a project as an asset.

**Build Scene** is a browser-based shot composer for blocking out cinematic shots before generating AI images or video. One composition model (`scene_json`) drives both preview and export, and the **Three.js viewport is the single surface**: it previews the scene, captures stills, and exports video (one deterministic `MediaRecorder` pass of the object keyframes + camera track, then normalized server-side to **H.264 MP4 via ffmpeg** so the Playground "From Build Scene" picker always receives a real MP4). **Camera framing is the user's job** — keyed from the timeline — while the agent animates objects through the `shot_*` keyframe tools. There are **no camera-beat tools** and **no ComfyUI** in this surface; agent gates (**Brief** before mutate, **Cut** before export) keep the agent honest. Scenes are managed like AI Canvas chats: a left rail holds compositions bound to agent sessions, and the agent panel drives the same scene through built-in `shot_*` tools (no MCP).

**Agents** is a chat-driven way to run the same pipeline: talk to a production agent that operates Calliope through tools (create project, draft story, write script, queue asset/video renders, watch jobs). Every chat session is bound to at most one project — start a **Sandbox** chat with no project and the agent materializes one via `create_project`, linking the session automatically; or link a session to an existing project and ask for edits. Complex builds are decomposed by a planner into sub-agents (story → script → assets → video). Everything the agent does goes through the same database and render queue the project UI reads — nothing bypasses the normal pipeline. When the agent waits on renders (`wait_for_jobs`), it uses the same **Poll timeout** as the queue worker (default 30 minutes).

### Drive Calliope from Claude Code (MCP)

The backend is also an **MCP server** at `http://127.0.0.1:8247/mcp` (streamable HTTP), so Claude Code — or any MCP client — can run the whole pipeline with the same tools the in-app agent uses: create/select a project, write the story (beats, characters, locations, items), the script (scenes, clips, `break_into_shots`), queue reference images and video clips, and watch jobs. Tools run **inside the backend**, so every change shows up live in the web app.

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http calliope http://127.0.0.1:8247/mcp
```

With authentication enabled, issue a dedicated API token on the server using
`.venv\Scripts\python -m calliope.auth token`, then configure the MCP client
to send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request. Tokens expire after
30 days and are revoked by a password change/reset. Do not put tokens in URLs,
commit them, or reuse browser session cookies as API credentials.

Opening Claude Code in this folder also picks up the bundled `.mcp.json`. Start with `list_projects` → `select_project` (or `create_project`, which selects the new project); the selection is kept on a **Claude Code (MCP)** session. Rendering tools (`enqueue_asset_jobs`, `enqueue_video_jobs`, `run_workflow`) and deletions are flagged destructive, so Claude Code asks before running them — that prompt replaces the chat-based render approval. Build Scene, AI Canvas, `ask_user` and `run_command` stay in the app. The endpoint only answers `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` hosts.

**Who writes the content.** Settings → Agent → **MCP content source** (default **MCP client**): for MCP calls Calliope's own LLM is never used — the client writes the story, script, shots, continuity plan and video prompts. `generate_story`, `generate_script`, `break_into_shots` and `set_continuity_plan` called *without* `content` / `plan` return a **brief** (the exact instructions and context Calliope's LLM would get); called *with* it, they validate and save through the same code paths, and nothing is deleted until the content passes. Video: `get_prompt_brief` → write each H3 prompt → `set_clip_prompts` (format-checked, saved as the clip's draft shown in *Review prompt*) → `enqueue_video_jobs`, which refuses clips without a current prompt. A continuity plan written by the client is kept across renders. Switch the setting to **Calliope's LLM** to have the same tools generate as before; the in-app agent and UI buttons always use Calliope's LLM.

## ComfyUI workflows (important)

Calliope does **not** hardcode Comfy node IDs. It discovers editable nodes from **role tags** in the node titles of an **API Format** workflow JSON. The `example_ComfyUI_workflows/` folder in this repo contains ready-to-import examples (MiniMax H3 reference-to-video, krea2 text-to-image, character sheet).

### 1. Tag your nodes in ComfyUI

Rename the input/output nodes so their titles carry a role tag:

```text
Display Name (Input:role)
Display Name (Output:role)
```

The display name can be anything, in any language. The `:role` part is the contract. Examples:

```text
Main Prompt (Input:prompt)
Neg (Input:negative)
W (Input:width)
H (Input:height)
Char Ref (Input:character)
Env Ref (Input:location)
Result (Output:image)
Clip (Output:video)
```

### 2. Canonical roles

Input roles:

| Role | Aliases | Filled by |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt` | `positive` | Entity Image prompt (Assets), scene/job prompt |
| `negative` | `neg` | Negative prompt when provided |
| `width` | `w` | Shared form / defaults |
| `height` | `h` | Shared form / defaults |
| `character` | `char`, `portrait`, `sheet`, `face`, `ref` | Character reference path |
| `location` | `loc`, `environment`, `env`, `background`, `scene` | Location reference path |
| `image` | `img` | Generic image input (ordered ref slot — see below) |
| `video` | `vid` | Video file input (`LoadVideo`) |
| `audio` | `sound`, `sfx` | Audio file input (`LoadAudio`) |
| `seed` | — | Shared form |
| `duration` | `dur`, `length`, `seconds` | Scene duration (video jobs) |

Output roles:

| Role | Aliases |
|---|---|
| `image` | `img` |
| `video` | `vid` |

Unknown roles still show up in the dynamic form; they just get no special auto-fill. Plain `(Input)` / `(Output)` without a role still works through a deprecated label fallback, so old workflows keep working — but tag new workflows with explicit roles.

#### Prompt profiles

Each workflow has a **Prompt format** setting (default *Plain prose*). When set to *MiniMax H3 reference (6-section)*, Calliope rewrites each scene prompt at generation time into MiniMax H3's full-reference format (`subject_definitions` → `summary` → `retention_analysis` → `detailed_description` → `overall_soundscape` → `non_diegetic_music`, with `<Subject N>` labels and `<d>[Language] …</d>` dialogue). It is auto-suggested on import when the workflow contains a `MiniMaxH3*` node.

For multi-reference workflows, generic `(Input:image)` inputs are filled in **node-id order** — characters in scene order, then the location — and that order defines the `<Subject N>` numbering in the prompt. Keep your ref node ids in the order you want subjects numbered. A `(Input:duration)` node receives the scene's duration in seconds.

**Using the H3 profile from the scene form (Generate clip):** the form's auto-fill vs. override rule is simple — anything you type or pick wins over the automatic value.

- **Text Prompt — leave it empty.** An empty field gets the LLM-rewritten six-section H3 prompt built from the scene's action, dialogue, characters, and location. If you type anything, your text is sent verbatim and the model receives plain prose instead of the H3 format.
- **Ref 1 / Ref 2 — leave them on "Choose asset…"** to auto-fill from the scene's characters (in scene order) then the location, with `<Subject N>` numbering matched to those slots. Picking an asset manually overrides just that slot (and you take over subject numbering for it).
- **Duration** auto-fills from the scene's estimated duration; edit it only when you want a different clip length.

### Continue from previous clip (video extend)

Long takes don't have to be one giant generation. Mark a clip **Continue from previous clip** in the **Script** stage (the toggle lives on a scene when it hasn't been expanded — expanding migrates it onto the clip) and instead of cutting a fresh clip, it extends the previous clip in the timeline as real continuation footage (the first clip can't use the toggle).

The **Video** stage enforces one requirement: the workflow must have an input tagged `(Input:video)` (a `LoadVideo` node). Continue clips on a workflow without one have Generate disabled with a warning.

When the workflow qualifies, a **clip source picker** appears on the continue scene:

- **Auto** (default) — the previous clip in timeline order is used, resolved when the job actually runs.
- **Upload file** — extend from any video you provide (a Playground upload).
- **From timeline** — pick a specific earlier clip explicitly.

Auto is safe even when clips are queued in one batch: Calliope's queue renders one job at a time, so by the time a continue clip runs, the clip before it has already rendered and is picked up automatically.

The workflow pattern (per [kat3ri/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Extend](https://github.com/kat3ri/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Extend)) is a `LoadVideo (Input:video)` node feeding the MiniMax H3 extend patched nodes (`MiniMaxH3EncodeAVPatched` → `MiniMaxH3VideoExtendPatched`) with the `(Output:video)` node at the end. Recommended starting settings from that repo: `context_frames` **2**, `ref_spacing` **1–2**, `ref_decay` **0.3**, `ref_ramp` **3–4** (5–6 if the prior clip had heavy motion).

### Review the prompt before you generate

Generate no longer fires blind. Hitting **Generate** first opens a prompt preview: the exact text that will land on the workflow's `(Input:prompt)` node — your saved draft if there is one, otherwise a fresh MiniMax H3 rewrite (six-section format) or the prose clip prompt (scene heading, the clip's shot description, and only the dialogue lines that clip performs).

- **Edit it inline** — typos, camera notes, pacing, anything. The edited text is what gets sent.
- **Regenerate** re-runs the H3 rewrite for a different take.
- **Save draft** keeps it on the clip; future generates (single or **Generate all**) reuse the draft instead of calling the LLM again. A hint appears when the draft predates changes to the scene or clip.
- **Cancel** aborts with nothing enqueued.

After a render, **View prompt & inputs** opens the scene's render history: every job as a chip, the payload each one actually sent to ComfyUI, and **Copy settings to form** to pull a past job's input values back into the live form.

Your video-stage setup (workflow choice, input values, clip source) auto-saves and comes back after a reload or app restart. **Generate all** honors every saved setup and draft — the toast reports how many drafts were used.

### Better ComfyUI errors

When ComfyUI rejects a workflow, the job error now names the actual cause and node — e.g. `ComfyUI rejected the workflow (400): prompt_outputs_failed_validation; node 12: Invalid audio file: "voice.m4a"` — instead of a bare status code. Audio reference inputs upload to ComfyUI's flat input directory and work with both stock `LoadAudio` and VHS's `VHS_LoadAudio`.

### Enhance generated clips

1. Generate the clips as usual, then open **Video → Enhance**.
2. Select a restoration/upscaling workflow. It must have an `(Input:video)` and an `(Output:video)` node. The selected clip's **original video** is passed in automatically; no file picking or changes to the generation workflow are needed.
3. If the workflow saves several videos, select the desired **Result to keep**. For the supplied Wan workflow, choose **Restored & Upscaled Video** for the final output or **Enhanced Video** for the intermediate result.
4. Click **Enhance clip**, or **Enhance all** to apply the displayed enhancement settings to every rendered clip in timeline order. Missing originals and clips already being processed are skipped. Progress, cancellation and retries use the normal render queue.
5. Compare both previews and choose **Original** or **Enhanced** under **Version for the film**, or use the version selector on each clip in **Film**. A completed enhancement is selected automatically. Export the film after processing finishes; changing a selected version marks a previous export as out of date.

Enhancement settings are saved independently per clip. Regenerating an original makes its earlier enhancement out of date and switches that clip back to the new original. Project archives with videos preserve both versions and the film selection.

`example_ComfyUI_workflows/Wan21_Restore_Enhance_Upscale_API.json` is the tagged API version of the supplied visual Wan workflow. It requires WanVideoWrapper, VideoHelperSuite, KJNodes, Frame Interpolation, the listed LoRAs, RealESRGAN and RIFE models. In particular, `Wan2_1-T2V-14B_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors` must be visible under ComfyUI's diffusion models and `Wan2_1_VAE_bf16.safetensors` under its VAEs. This preset resamples input to 24 fps, crops to 960×720, and produces a final 2880×2160 video at 48 fps. Edit the workflow's dimensions/framing in ComfyUI for a different aspect ratio. Film export still normalizes the selected clips to 1080p.

### 3. Export the workflow

In ComfyUI, use **Save (API Format)** — not the regular UI workflow graph format. Calliope only understands API Format JSON.

### 4. Import into Calliope

Settings → Workflows → import the JSON → **analyze** → check the preview shows the expected **role** next to each input → save → enable the workflow where you want to use it (Assets, Playground, per scene).

#### Low VRAM (8GB) Workflows
For consumer GPUs with 8GB VRAM (e.g. RTX 4060, RTX 3070), optimized ready-to-import workflows are available in `example_ComfyUI_workflows/`:
- `video_minimax_h3_r2v_*_LowVRAM_API.json` (1-ref through 5-ref Reference-to-Video)
- `minimax_h3-Turbo_Text2Video_20260813_LowVRAM_API.json` (Text-to-Video)
- `minimax_h3-Turbo_Image2Video_20260813_LowVRAM_API.json` (Image-to-Video)

Their visual canvas counterparts (for drag-and-drop into ComfyUI) are provided in `Calliope_Optimized/`.

These workflows are tuned to prevent out-of-memory errors by:
- Using `qwen3vl_32b_minimax_h3_nvfp4_awq.safetensors` and `minimax_h3_ref2va_pruned_int8_convrot.safetensors`
- Integrating `LayerUtility: PurgeVRAM V2` to unload text encoder and diffusion models between stages
- Setting tuned resolution and scheduler steps suitable for 8GB cards.

### 5. Troubleshooting

If ComfyUI "doesn't know what to generate" or jobs come back empty:

- The workflow title must be literally `(Input:prompt)` — not only `(Input)` — for prompts to land reliably.
- Check the job payload: `input_values` for that node must be non-empty (blanks are stripped before submission).
- Make sure **Dry-run** is off in Settings (default is off).
- An unreachable ComfyUI fails the job honestly — Calliope never silently fakes images. Check the base URL and that ComfyUI is running.

### 6. HTTP only

Calliope talks to ComfyUI purely over its HTTP API: it uploads reference files with `POST /upload/image`, patches the workflow JSON and queues it via `POST /prompt`, polls `/history/{prompt_id}`, and downloads the results. It **never reads or writes ComfyUI's local `input/` / `output/` folders** — any folder paths stay configured on the ComfyUI side, not in Calliope.
