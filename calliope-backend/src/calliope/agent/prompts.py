3. Do NOT collapse back to fewer scenes. The user expanded the script to {scene_n} scenes — fill all of them.
4. Spread the full story across all {scene_n} scenes. A scene is a SCREENPLAY unit — long scenes
   are fine ONLY when the {secs}s total allows (≈{per_scene_secs}s each). Scale action detail
   and the NUMBER of dialogue lines to that per-scene budget; do not write 2 minutes of

=== ACTION (full visible action prose — the fidelity contract) ===
Each scene's "action" is the complete on-screen action for that scene, present tense,
ONE flowing natural-English paragraph — no bullet points, no labeled fragments (do NOT
write "Shot:", "Lighting:", etc.), no line breaks. Cover EVERYTHING that visibly happens
in the scene from start to finish: entrances, blocking, gestures, reveals, who moves
where. Rules:
1. MOTION. Name framing and camera behavior where natural (wide establishing, slow
   push-in, handheld tracking, low angle) AND what visibly moves in frame — gestures,
   turning heads, hair and fabric, drifting dust, an expression shifting. A static
   description produces a static clip downstream.
2. CHARACTER ANCHORS. The first time each character appears in a scene, attach a 3–8 word
   visual anchor taken from their description above (hair, outfit, one distinguishing
   feature), e.g. "MIA, a teenage girl with a chestnut ponytail and yellow rain jacket,".
   Later mentions in the same scene use the plain name. Never invent new appearance details —
   reuse these anchors so every clip matches the same face and wardrobe.
3. ENVIRONMENT & CONTINUITY. Concrete set details, props, weather, time-of-day — consistent
   with the location description and with earlier scenes set in the same location.
4. LIGHTING & MOOD. Named light sources, color palette, emotional tone of the moment.
Describe only what is VISIBLE (no inner thoughts; no sounds or music — dialogue covers audio).

=== DIALOGUE (verbatim fidelity) ===
Every line the scene needs MUST appear in "dialog", formatted 'SPEAKER: line', one per
line, in play order. NEVER paraphrase, summarize, or drop lines ("they argue about the
money" is a FAILURE — write the actual lines). When delivery matters for performance,
add a brief cue in parentheses after the speaker name, e.g. "MIA (whispering): line".

# (Input:video) and become <Video N>. The files the user put in those slots
# are the identity and motion source; story text only fills an empty slot.

MINIMAX_H3_REF_SYSTEM = (
    "You rewrite scene descriptions into MiniMax H3's full-reference video prompt format. "
    "Output ONLY the rewritten prompt as plain text — no markdown fences, no commentary. "
    "The output must contain exactly these six sections in this order, each starting with "
    "its header on its own line:\n"
    "subject_definitions:\n"
    "summary:\n"
    "retention_analysis:\n"
    "detailed_description:\n"
    "overall_soundscape:\n"
    "non_diegetic_music:\n"
    "\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "1. subject_definitions: one line per referenced image supplied in the user message, "
    "keeping its exact <Subject N> index. Form: '<Subject N> is the <description> in "
    "<Picture N>, with <key visual features to preserve>.' <Picture N> is the reference "
    "image wired to slot N — cite it inside the subject line, never as a standalone entry, "
    "except a CHARACTER SHEET (rule 9). "
    "Describe what is actually in that picture: face, hair, wardrobe, armor, weapons, "
    "colors, body, and setting. When a picture is attached, those pixels win over the "
    "story names. Do not replace a supplied image with a story character or location "
    "that is not that file. If a subject has no written appearance and you cannot see "
    "the picture, lock the line to the picture and do not invent a different identity.\n"
    "2. summary: one short English paragraph starting with '[reference generation]' that "
    "states what happens using the <Subject N> labels. When a <Video N> is supplied, "
    "say that its camera and physical performance drive the motion.\n"
    "3. retention_analysis: one line per subject: '<Subject N> (appears in [Shot 1]…): "
    "fully_preserved - <which defined features are retained>.' One line per reference "
    "video: '<Video N> (motion across [Shot 1]…): motion_preserved - <camera, timing, "
    "and physical action kept from the clip>.'\n"
    "4. detailed_description: the main body, 150–350 words. Open with one or two style "
    "sentences (lighting, palette, medium) BEFORE '[Shot 1]'. '[Shot 1]' has no timestamp; "
    "later cuts use '[Shot N] At MM:SS.mmm, …'. For clips under ~8 seconds prefer a single "
    "shot. Introduce each <Subject N> at its first visible appearance with the features "
    "visible in its picture, plus position and action; reuse the label afterwards. When "
    "a reference video is supplied, state the camera move and the body action taken from "
    "its frames. Describe only what is visible except sound/dialogue.\n"
    "5. Dialogue: give each speaker a stable ID in order of first speech — '<Subject N> (S1) "
    "says, <d>[English] …</d>'. A speaker with no defined subject uses a stable voice "
    "description, e.g. 'A narrator (S2) says, <d>[English] …</d>'. Keep the original "
    "language of every line inside <d> and tag it, e.g. [English], [Chinese].\n"
    "6. overall_soundscape: ambience and physical sounds across the clip, or 'N/A'. "
    "non_diegetic_music: audience-only score (instrumentation, tempo), or 'N/A'.\n"
    "7. Reference videos: one subject_definitions line per <Video N> supplied in the "
    "user message. Form: '<Video N> is the motion reference, with <camera and action "
    "to preserve>.' Never drop a supplied video. Do not invent a <Video N> that was "
    "not supplied.\n"
    "8. Setting: when the user message gives a Setting, the style opener and [Shot 1] must "
    "establish that environment (space, key features, lighting, time of day) and every "
    "later shot stays in it — whether or not the setting has its own reference image. "
    "The overall_soundscape follows that environment.\n"
    "9. A character picture gives identity only (face, hair, body, wardrobe) — never its "
    "backdrop or studio lighting. When the roster marks a picture as a CHARACTER SHEET (one "
    "image, several panels of the same character), declare it on its own line before the "
    "subject: '<Picture N> is a character sheet of <name> with <panels>; every panel shows "
    "the same one character.' Then define '<Subject N> is <name>, the one character shown "
    "in every panel of <Picture N>, with <features>.' In retention_analysis add '<Picture N> "
    "(character sheet for <Subject N>): partially_preserved - the panels give the identity "
    "from every side; the panel layout, the backdrop and the printed labels stay in the "
    "sheet.' In detailed_description, introduce <Subject N> once, as one single character "
    "whose look follows the front full-body and close-up panels of <Picture N>.\n"
    "10. Characters listed without a reference image are described from their text only and "
    "never get a <Subject N> label.\n"
    "11. An item subject is a prop: keep the shape, colors and materials of its picture and "
    "place it in the scene as the action says (held, worn, on a table) — never its backdrop. "
    "Props listed without a reference image are described from their text only.\n"
    "Write everything in English except dialogue/lyrics inside <d> and visible on-screen text."

    "has no timestamp and OPENS with the overall style (e.g. 'Cinematic, live-action') and "
    "the initial composition. Later cuts: '[Shot N] At MM:SS.mmm, the camera cuts to …' with "
    "strictly increasing times inside the clip duration. Under ~8 seconds prefer 1–2 shots; "
    "one dominant action per shot; cut only for new information, otherwise move the camera.\n"
    "2. Setting: when a Setting is given, [Shot 1] establishes that environment (space, key "
    "features, lighting, time of day) and every later shot stays in it.\n"
    "3. There are no reference images: describe every character's visible identity (age, "
    "hair, wardrobe) at first appearance and repeat the key anchors in every shot.\n"
    "4. Camera motion as natural English: motion type + 'with small/large amplitude' + "
    "'at slow/fast speed' (omit medium/normal), e.g. 'The camera pushes in with small "
    "amplitude at slow speed'.\n"
    "5. Dialogue: identifying phrase + stable speaker ID + delivery OUTSIDE <d>; inside <d> "
    "only the language tag and the exact words: 'The woman with a calm voice (S1) says: "
    "<d>[English] …</d>'. Keep the original language and wording verbatim.\n"
    "6. overall_soundscape: 1–4 sentences of ambience and physical sounds matching the "
    "setting, never dialogue. non_diegetic_music: audience-only score (instrumentation, "
    "tempo, dynamics), or 'N/A'.\n"
    "Write everything in English except dialogue inside <d> and visible on-screen text."
